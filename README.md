# gentoo-installscript
DISCLAIMER: PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU HAVE NEVER DONE A MANUAL GENTOO INSTALLATION BEFORE. THE HASSLE YOU WILL ENCOUNTER LATER IS NOT WORTH THE CONVENIENCE NOW.
(To whom it may concern: This applies to many apparently 'genius' things in life.)

This is a simple script for a Gentoo installation, new functionality will be added periodically.

### To-Do-List
* automatic partitioning
* automatic formatting
* use of custom kernel configurations instead of 'genkernel all'
* choice between openrc/systemd
* add KDE/GNOME/both/more
* correct date (if necessary)
* base make.conf on host system 
* add user input for:
	* Filesystem
	* Partition Size
	* UEFI/BIOS
	* Profiles 
	* Locales
	* Timezone
	* Hostname
* add some grub theme
* add plymouth theme
* custom username
* and surely some other things I forgot for now.
